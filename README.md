I edited this hmtl and css file(s) in order to gain expirience and further my knowledge during the bootcamp.

It solves the issue of accessability of people unable to normally interact with the website. The following general changes were made to the original file:
-"sections" of the program were modified with semantics in order to be read in specifics by accessability assistance programs.
-image links were changed to have an alt, so as to be readable by accessability assistance programs.
-css file pathing was changed to keep relative pathing correct after moving the index.html file in the root.
-Tab title was edited to show a more specific title while browsing multiple tabs.
-css file contents were changed in order to keep styling(s) after changing from div to section

I personally learned how to properly edit and keep the integrity of a pre-made website through VS Code and how to pull-add-commit-push and merge files through the use of Git.
